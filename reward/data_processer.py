( give way road markings ) \n\nbut because it was clear when I checked it I drove on, and when I was almost past the intersection he slammed me in the side near the back seat. and caused me to slide across the road for 2-3 meters hit a street light and then bounce back a meter. both doors completely jammed so i had to climb out the window...\n\ncan I somehow get an investigation going about this to see how fast he had to be driving to get this much force in the collision?\nbecause the damage on my car would suggest that he was driving way faster than the legal limit there. ( which is 50 km/h )\n\nalso another reason why i think he was going way faster than admitted is because he could never have reached the intersection from such a distance as where i could not even see him yet\n\n(pictures of the damage:  ) as you can see with the damage, I am lucky to be alive and unharmed right now... 1ft further forward and it could have been my end...\n\nhelp would be appeciated on this :)",

    #     "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I eat too much fast food. What's a way to start cooking at home more?\n\nAssistant: The easiest way to start cooking more at home is to cook a few meals a week and keep those meals varied. Planning meals and having a list ready will make cooking much easier. Shopping once a week will also keep your meals varied. Try cooking a few recipes you've never made before. Maybe you could try some Italian, Mexican, or Asian dishes. Cooking more at home is also a great way to save money. You can buy ingredients in bulk and cook large portions, which will last you several days.\n\nHuman: Tell me about buying in bulk. Will that make the process easier?\n\nAssistant: Buying in bulk will definitely make cooking and planning meals easier. The key to buying in bulk is to only buy what you know you will use. Keeping a well-stocked pantry with a variety of dried and canned goods will make cooking easier. Buying in bulk will save you money and give you greater variety in your meals.\n\nHuman: How does one buy in bulk?\n\nAssistant:",
    #     "response": " To buy in bulk, start by shopping at warehouse stores or specialty stores. Make a list of the items you usually use in meals and the amounts you use. Make a note of the unit prices for those items. You can then compare unit prices at warehouse stores to see if they're lower. If they are, buy in bulk from warehouse stores. Also, check online for even bigger savings. Another way to buy in bulk is to join a grocery co-op, which is a group of people who buy food in bulk and then split the cost.",

You can find organic dried pasta, nuts, baking items, and spices in bulk. When shopping for groceries, buy the largest package or container possible to get the largest savings. Organic, bulk food is more expensive than traditional packaged food, but much cheaper than organic grocery stores. You can get many non-perishable items for half price or less when buying in bulk."
