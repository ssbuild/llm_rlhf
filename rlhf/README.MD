  "prompt": "SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: First date ever, going to the beach. Would like some tips\nPOST: Hey Reddit! I (20M) would like some tips, because I have my first ever date tomorrow (although I've had a gf for 3 years, but no actual dating happened), and we're going to the beach.\n\nI met this girl, we have mutual friends, at a festival a few days ago. We didn't kiss, but we talked, held hands, danced a bit. I asked her to go on a date with me, which was super hard as it is the first time I've asked this to anybody. What I mean to say is, it's not like a standard *first* date because we already spent some time together.\n\nI'm really nervous and excited. I'm going to pick her up tomorrow, we're cycling to the beach which will take 30 minutes, and then what? I'm a bit scared. Should I bring something (the weather, although no rain and sunny, is not super so no swimming), should we do something. I'd like all the tips I can get. Thanks!\nTL;DR: ",
